## Technology Stack

Built with a focus on performance, aesthetics, and modern web standards:

- **Core**: React 18, Vite
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Custom Variable System), Glassmorphism Effects
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Development & AI Generation

This entire project was architected and implemented using **Antigravity**, an advanced agentic coding assistant from Google DeepMind.

- **Automated Coding**: >95% of the codebase (Components, CSS, Logic) was generated by Antigravity.
- **Agentic Workflow**: The AI autonomously handled planning, file creation, verifying layouts in the browser, and optimizing responsiveness.
- **Dynamic Logic**: Complex features like the "self-equalizing" project grid and granular timeline positioning were implemented by the agent.
